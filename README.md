FROM [KMS Sql Case Study1]  
GROUP BY Ship_Mode  
ORDER BY [Total Shipping Cost] DESC;

-- 6. Who are the most valuable customers and what do they purchase?

SELECT TOP 1 Customer_Name, Customer_Segment, COUNT([Order_ID]) AS [Total Orders]  
FROM [KMS Sql Case Study1]

ORDER BY [Total Profit] DESC;

-- 10. Which customer returned items and what segments do they belong to?
SELECT Customer_Name, Customer_Segment, [Status]

JOIN [dbo].[Order_Status]  
  ON [KMS Sql Case Study1].Order_ID = [dbo].[Order_Status].Order_ID;

-- 11. Did KMS appropriately spend shipping costs based on order priority?
SELECT Order_Priority, Ship_Mode,  
       COUNT([Order_ID]) AS [Order Count],  
       SUM(Sales - Profit) AS [Estimated Shipping Cost],  
       AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, [Order_Date], [Ship_Date])) AS [Avg Ship Days]  
FROM [KMS Sql Case Study1]  
GROUP BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode  
ORDER BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode DESC;

-- Conclusion:
-- No, KMS did not appropriately allocate shipping costs. Delivery trucks (economical) were overused,
-- even for urgent orders, while express air (costly) was underutilized. This resulted in inefficient spending.
